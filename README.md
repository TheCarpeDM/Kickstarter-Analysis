# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose
 The goal of this analysis is to help Louise run a successful Kickstarter Campaign using Excel spreadsheets, formulas, and charts. She ran an unsuccessful campaign previously, and wishes to do market research to help her decide on a better approach to running her kickstarter. The main variables she's interested in are timelines and goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 In the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart, we looked at kickstarters from the Theater category and sorted them by whether they were successful, failed, or canceled and plotted them based on the month of their start date. The data indicates that early summer appears to be the most successful time for theater kickstarters. May and June have the best ratios of Successful Campaigns to Failed Campaigns to Canceled Campaigns (May - 111:52:3, June - 100:49:4). These two months are the only months with greater than a 2:1 Success rate, so based on the data, May is the best month to start Louise's campaign with June a close second.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, we looked at kickstarters from the Theater category and categorized them based on their stated goal. Then we found the percentage of each group that were successful, the percentage that failed, and the percentage that were canceled. Based on Louise's initial estimate that she needs $10,000, the majority of the data indicates that keeping her goal between $10k and $15k seems to be the best idea (with a 60% success rate). There are some kickstarters in the $35k-$45k ranges that were successful, though this is based on only a few successful campaigns, so more investigation might be worthwhile to ensure the campaigns reflect sufficient similarity to Louise's campaign.
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 As stated in the Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, there is potential for further investigation of how higher goals impact success since there was significantly less data available for the higher goal data points. Also, since we were only comparing kickstarters in the Theater category, the correlation to Louise's specific kickstarter plans may be limited since the category includes more than just plays.
 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 First, that May and June have the best ratios of successful to unsuccessful kickstarters. Also that October and december have the worst ratio of successful to unsuccessful kickstarters.
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  Based on our categories, the two lowest categories had the highest success rates.
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 We broadened our data to include more kinds of projects than just play productions, so the conclusions may be affected by non-play productions. Also, our data doesn't take into consideration marketing for the kickstarter campaign (including data which was present in the dataset, but not analyzed by our spreadsheet). 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 We could add a table that compares success and failure based on whether the project was spotlighted or a staff pick. We could also narrow the data down to just plays rather than all theater projects.
